## Getting started

### Compiling the source code

See the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for more information.

If you do not have Git installed and set up on your local machine, you can download a ZIP archive of the repository under the <kbd><> Code</kbd> dropdown menu. To compile the source code, run Visual Studio 2022 (or later versions) and open the uncompressed folder, then compile the project from the IDE.

#### Using a command line interface (CLI)

1. Create/open an empty folder on your local machine to store the project files.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory of the folder.
    - **Windows:** To do this in an efficient manner, enter the folder in the default file explorer and click on the directory breadcrumb. Then, type <kbd>C</kbd> <kbd>M</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> followed by <kbd>Enter</kbd> to directly initialise a Windows terminal at the location of your desired folder.
3.  Clone this repository using the following command:
   
```
git clone https://github.com/ST10257002/VCGPPT-PROG6221-POE
```

4. Open the source folder in Visual Studio 2022 *(or later versions)* and compile the program.
