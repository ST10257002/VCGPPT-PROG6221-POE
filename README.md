## Getting started

### Compiling the source code

See the [official documentation](https://www.notion.so/Introduction-to-network-types-and-components-a84be3f419824a07b691936413f9f137?pvs=4) for more information.

1. Create/open an empty folder on your local machine to store the project files.
2. **Windows:** enter the folder and type <kbd>cmd</kbd> or <kbd>powershell</kbd> to your choosing into the directory/breadcrumb field, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open a command line terminal at this location, or do it manually.
    - If you are using a different operating system or do not have Git installed on your local machine, download the repository as an archive, and then decompress it to access the project files. This is also applicable if you do not wish to use the recommended method above.
3. Confirm that you are in the correct directory, then copy and run the following command:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/ST10257002/VCGPPT-PROG6221-POE
```

4. Open the source folder in Visual Studio 2022 *(or later versions)* and compile the program.
